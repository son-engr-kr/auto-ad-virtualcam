# 2025 Dream AI Hackathon: EchoBoard

# Scope

This project aims to develop an AI-powered virtual camera system for Zoom meetings that dynamically displays context-relevant advertisements and branded backgrounds using real-time face detection and speech recognition. By integrating speech-to-text recognition with keyword-based ad matching, the system detects the topic of conversation (e.g., web hosting) and displays tailored ads/backgrounds (e.g., Amazon AWS) or company logos behind participants via pyvirtualcam, all while making sure a seamless user experience through OpenCV-based face detection and background overlay.
